ABSTRACT={In this paper, we propose a hierarchical spatial concept formation method based on the Bayesian
generative model with multimodal information e.g. vision, position and word information. Since
humans have the ability to select an appropriate level of abstraction according to the situation
and describe their position linguistically, e.g. ”I am in my home” and ”I am in front of the table,”
a hierarchical structure of spatial concepts is necessary in order for human support robots to
communicate smoothly with users. The proposed method enables a robot to form hierarchical
spatial concepts by categorizing multimodal information using hierarchical multimodal latent
Dirichlet allocation (hMLDA). Object recognition results using convolutional neural network (CNN),
hierarchical k-means clustering result of self-position estimated by Monte Carlo localization
(MCL), and a set of location names are used, respectively, as features in vision, position, and
word information. Experiments in forming hierarchical spatial concepts and evaluating how the
proposed method can predict unobserved location names and position categories are performed
using a robot in the real world. Results verify that, relative to comparable baseline methods, the
proposed method enables a robot to predict location names and position categories closer to
predictions made by humans. As an application example of the proposed method in a home
environment, a demonstration in which a human support robot moves to an instructed place based
on human speech instructions is achieved based on the formed hierarchical spatial concept.}
